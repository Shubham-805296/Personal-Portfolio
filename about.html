            <h3><li> Hi! I'm Shubham Gupta, a passionate and curious BTech student <br>at United University, Prayagraj. <br>I’m
                deeply interested in
                web development and emerging technologies,<br> and I’ve been building my skill <br> set through both
                academic learning and
                hands-on experiences. <br> <br></li>
            <li>I have practical knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, which helps me <br> design clean, responsive
                websites. <br>I'm also
                learning JavaScript and Python to add more interactivity and <br>functionality to my projects. <br><br></li>
            <li>Beyond the classroom, I’ve actively participated in hackathons that <br>challenged my creativity and
                problem-solving skills. <br>
                I’ve also completed certifications and attended workshops on <br>Cybersecurity and Machine Learning, including a
                highly inspiring <br>one organized by IIT Kanpur. <br><br></li>
            <li>Through these experiences, I’ve discovered a love for blending <br>logic with design — building things that are
                not only
                useful but <br>also meaningful. <br>Creating my own portfolio site is one of the many steps I’m <br>taking to grow,
                learn, and
                connect with opportunities in the tech world.</li></h3>
